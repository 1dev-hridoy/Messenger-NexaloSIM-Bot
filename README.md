A Node.js-based Facebook Messenger bot using the `ws3-fca` package, integrated with the Nexalo SIM API for custom AI-driven features. This bot supports a command system with a configurable prefix, processes messages in real-time via MQTT, and includes error handling and colorful logging with `chalk`.

## Features

- **Command System**: Dynamic command loading with a prefix (default: `!`).
- **Nexalo SIM Integration**: Custom AI-powered chat and training capabilities.
- **Media Support**: Fetch and send MP3 songs with the `sing` command.
- **Utility Commands**: Includes `ping`, `uptime`, `help`, and `remove` commands.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retries for network issues.
- **Logging**: Colorful console logs using `chalk` for better debugging.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher.
- **Facebook Account**: For generating `appState.json`.
- **Nexalo SIM API Key**: For AI features (`chat` and `teach` commands).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1dev-hridoy/Messenger-NexaloSIM-Bot.git
   cd Messenger-NexaloSIM-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Generate `appState.json`**:
   Use a tool like fbstate to generate `appState.json` with your Facebook login cookies.
   Place the `appState.json` file in the project root.

4. **Configure the Bot**:
   Edit `config.json` to set your botâ€™s name, prefix, and admin UIDs:
   ```json
   {
     "botName": "MyBot",
     "prefix": "!",
     "adminName": "AdminUser",
     "adminUIDs": ["your-facebook-uid"]
   }
   ```

5. **Set Nexalo SIM API Key**:
   Replace `MAINPOINT` in `commands/chat.js` and `commands/teach.js` with your actual Nexalo SIM API key.

6. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
The bot listens for messages in Messenger and responds to commands starting with the prefix (default: `!`).
Example: `!sing happy birthday` fetches and sends an MP3 of the song "Happy Birthday".

### Available Commands

|---------|--------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|
| chat    | talk, sim    | Chat with the Nexalo SIM API        | `!chat <question>`           | AI       |
| teach   | train, learn | Train the Nexalo SIM API            | `!teach <question> | <answer>` | Training |
| ping    | pong, latency| Check the bot's response time       | `!ping`                      | Utility  |
| sing    | song, music  | Fetch and send an MP3 of a song     | `!sing <song name>`          | Media    |
| uptime  | status, server| Display server info and uptime      | `!uptime`                    | Utility  |
| help    | commands, cmd| List all commands or show details   | `!help [command name]`       | Utility  |
| remove  | delete       | Remove a bot message (reply to it)  | `!remove (reply to msg)`     | Utility  |

## Configuration

### `config.json`:
- `botName`: Name of your bot.
- `prefix`: Command prefix (e.g., `!`).
- `adminName`: Name of the admin.
- `adminUIDs`: Array of Facebook UIDs allowed to use admin-only commands.

### Nexalo SIM API Key:
Replace `MAINPOINT` in `chat.js` and `teach.js` with your API key.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding:
- Ensure `appState.json` is valid and not expired.
- Check if the bot has permissions in the chat.
- Verify the prefix in `config.json` matches your command (default: `!`).

### API Errors:
- If the `sing` command fails, the API (https://apis-rho-nine.vercel.app/ytsdlmp3) might be down. Check the console logs for details.
- For `chat` or `teach`, ensure your Nexalo SIM API key is correct.

### File Permission Issues:
- Ensure the bot has write permissions for the `commands/` directory to download files (e.g., MP3s, images).
